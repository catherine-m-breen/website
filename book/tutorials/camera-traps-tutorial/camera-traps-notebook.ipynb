    "## What is a camera trap?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A camera trap (sometimes referred to as a remote camera or hunting camera) is similar to a normal camera except they:\n",
    "    - can detect  and take pictures when motion is in their vicinity. \n",
    "    - can take pictures at consistent intervals at settings preset by the user.  \n",
    "    - are designed to withstand harsh conditions and to be left up for long periods of time.  \n",
    "- Their potential for snow hydrology is exciting. Consistent daily camera trap photos can be analyzed contiously to form a *time-lapse* of snow conditions at one location. They can operate in sub-freezing temperatures and during storms -- conditions when access with other types of measurements would have been difficult. "

    "- During the 2020 SnowEx field campaign, 30 cameras were installed in Grand Mesa, CO between September and May. \n",
    "- Cameras were installed across a vegetation gradient on a scale of 1 (least vegetation and ) to 9 (most vegetation). Within each vegetation class there are three sub-classes of snow depths: shallow, intermediate, and deep snow, that were derived from 2017 SnowEx lidar measurements. \n",
    "- Below is an example site, site XX, \n",
    "- 2017 camera trap time-lapse imagery has been submitted to the NSIDC. 2020 time-lapse is in progress for submission to the NSIDC with estimation of submission as summer 2021. "
